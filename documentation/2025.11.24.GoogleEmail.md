Action Required: Regarding your [DeepSeek] Integration for Project 811650947375(Project ID: savemyattachments).

Hello Developer,

We are reviewing your OAuth verification request for Project 811650947375(Project ID: savemyattachments). Our review found that your application integrates directly with DeepSeek, which conflicts with Google's data protection policies.

The public terms of services like [AI Service Name] indicate they reserve the right to use content sent to them to train their general AI models. This practice violates the Limited use of user data requirement of the Google API Services User Data Policy, which prohibits using data obtained from Google APIs for training generalized AI models.

Due to this policy conflict, your application cannot be approved with its current architecture. To proceed with verification, you must choose one of the following options:

Option 1: Remove the Integration

Completely remove the direct integration that transfers Google User Data to DeepSeek and resubmit your project for review.

Option 2: Implement Data Segregation

If you choose to retain this integration, you must re-architect your application to ensure complete, auditable data isolation. This means you must guarantee that Google User Data obtained via any Google API is never sent to, or used by, the DeepSeek API. This may require a separate product feature, a dedicated user flow, or a technical architecture that uses only user-provided, non-Google-API data for the third-party AI service.

If you choose either of these options, you must provide a new demo video that clearly demonstrates the functionality.

Scope Verification

The scopes listed on your OAuth consent screen are different from the scopes requested in your Cloud Console submission.

Minimum Scope Requirement

You requested the following restricted Drive API scope(s):

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets

Please review the following information to understand if the drive.file scope is a better fit for your application. If your request does not meet the eligibility requirements outlined below, we won’t be able to grant your request for restricted Drive APIs.

Why should I use the drive.file scope?

Eligibility

We won’t be able to approve restricted Drive APIs for your application if your request does not meet the minimum scope requirement under the Workspace API user data and developer policy, which requires that permission requests be limited to the critical information necessary to implement your application’s services. Please note that UI preferences or client library limitations alone are not valid policy exceptions from these requirements.

User Experience

The drive.file scope allows the user to create Drive files, and select and modify any file from their Drive that they want to share with your application, including files not created with the application. This gives users more control and confidence that your application's access to their files is limited and secure.

In January 2025 the Google Picker API introduced a new method to the Class view called setFileIds(fileIds), which allows you to present users with a picker that is pre-navigated to the specified file IDs the application is seeking access to, allowing efficient file access directly from Google Drive file links and faster consent for your users. Read this update for more information.

No Verification Required

Since the drive.file scope is non-sensitive, approval is not required to use this scope. Additionally, note that all apps requesting access to restricted APIs must complete a third-party CASA security assessment before the restricted APIs can be approved; this assessment must also be recertified annually in order for the app to maintain access to restricted APIs. Since drive.file is not a restricted scope, this security assessment and annual recertification won’t be required.

What do I need to do next?

Please follow the instructions provided here to create another project for testing and use the recommended drive.file scope.

You can use the Google Picker API to display a file picker. Applications can narrow to certain Drive file types (e.g. docs, sheets, photos etc) , via a filter on the Google Picker files.

If your application is a Google Workspace add-on, you should use Advanced Drive Service in order to use the drive.file scope.

To allow users to select multiple files at once, use the PickerBuilder and enable the multiselect option.

The Google Picker API also supports selecting items in Shared Drives. For details around enabling shared drives support and adding shared drives view in the file picker, refer to Google Picker API.

If your app is a Workspace Add-on, you should use context-specific Drive or Editor Add-on Scopes, which ensure your app only requests access to the necessary resources within the user's active context.

IMPORTANT!

DO NOT remove any previously approved scopes from your project at this time

⤷ Reply to this email with the following information:

Option 1: If your app will work with the recommended scope(s), do the following:

Add the recommended scope(s) only to your Cloud Console project.

If the scopes your application does not need were not previously approved, remove these scope(s) from your application codebase and Cloud Console project now.

Reply to this email with "Confirming narrower scopes"

Option 2: If the recommended scope(s) will not work for your app, reply to this email with "Unable to use narrower scopes" and additional justification explaining why. (Learn more).

Important! Once you have addressed the issues above , reply directly to this email to confirm. You must reply to this email after fixing the highlighted issues to continue with the app verification process.

# Demo Video Recording Checklist
**Purpose:** Show OAuth authorization flow + data segregation
**Duration:** 4-6 minutes
**Date:** November 24, 2025

## 🎬 SCENE 1: OAuth Authorization Flow (0:00-1:00)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Open SaveMyAttachments for the first time (or revoke permissions first to trigger OAuth)

    - gmail.readonly - "View your email messages and settings"
    - drive.file - "See, edit, create, and delete only specific Google Drive files"
    - spreadsheets - "See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets"
    - script.external_request - "Connect to an external service"
- [ ] Click "Allow" button
- [ ] Show successful authorization (app loads)

**Voiceover plays:** "First, let me show you the OAuth authorization flow..."

**Pro tip:** If you need to re-trigger OAuth, go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions and revoke SaveMyAttachments, then open it again.

- [ ] Show lines 16-20 (runtime blocking code)
- [ ] Show lines 145-149 (API filtering code)
- [ ] Open SettingsPanel.html

**Option B: Try to use DeepSeek (if you want to demo runtime blocking):**
- [ ] Open Apps Script editor
- [ ] Temporarily modify code to set model = "deepseek-chat"
- [ ] Run processEmails()
- [ ] Show error message: "Summary unavailable - DeepSeek models not supported"

## 🎥 RECORDING TIPS

### Before Recording:
1. **Clear browser cache/cookies** - This ensures OAuth screen appears fresh
2. **Revoke app permissions** - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
3. **Prepare test data** - Have a few test emails ready in Gmail
4. **Test API key** - Have a real or fake OpenRouter API key ready to paste
5. **Close unnecessary windows/tabs** - Clean desktop for recording

### During Recording:
1. **Record in 1080p (1920x1080)** - Minimum resolution for Google's review
2. **Use full screen mode** - Hide browser toolbars if possible
3. **Slow mouse movements** - Give viewers time to see what you're clicking
4. **Pause on important screens** - Hold on OAuth consent for 3-5 seconds
5. **Zoom in on code** - If showing code, increase font size (Cmd/Ctrl +)

### Recording Tools:
- **QuickTime** (Mac): Built-in, simple, good quality
- **Loom**: Free, easy to use, auto-uploads
- **OBS Studio**: Free, more control, best quality
- **Screen Studio** (Mac): Professional, paid, best visual polish

### Voiceover:
- Use the updated `DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT_ELEVENLABS.txt`
- Upload to ElevenLabs for AI voiceover
- Or record your own voiceover with good microphone
- Add voiceover in post-production (iMovie, DaVinci Resolve, etc.)

## 🎯 KEY MESSAGE TO CONVEY

Google needs to see:
1. ✅ **User control** - OAuth consent screen shows what's being accessed
2. ✅ **Opt-in AI** - AI is disabled by default, requires user's API key
3. ✅ **Data segregation** - User's key → User's OpenRouter account → User's data
4. ✅ **DeepSeek blocked** - Three layers of protection prevent usage
5. ✅ **No developer access** - No shared infrastructure, no cross-user data mixing

**Next Step:** Record the video following this checklist, then upload and include link in your email to Google

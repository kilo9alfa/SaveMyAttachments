**Subject:** Re: CASA Requirement - Request for Clarification on gmail.readonly Scope

Hi Google Trust and Safety Team,

Thank you for reviewing our application. I understand that `gmail.readonly` is classified as a restricted scope requiring CASA assessment.

I'd like to request clarification on whether there's an alternative path for our use case:

**Our Application's Gmail Usage:**
- **Read-only** - We never modify, delete, or send emails
- **User-initiated only** - Processing only runs when user explicitly clicks "Process Emails"
- **Backup purpose only** - We extract attachments and save them to user's own Google Drive (using `drive.file` scope)
- **No bulk/automated access** - No background triggers that access Gmail without user action
- **No data leaves Google ecosystem** - Email content goes from Gmail → Drive → Sheets (all user-owned)
- **AI is optional** - Email summarization is opt-in, uses user's own API key, and can be disabled entirely

**Questions:** Given this limited, user-controlled, read-only use case:
1. Is there a narrower Gmail scope that would avoid the CASA requirement?
2. Is there an exception process for backup/archival applications?
3. If CASA is required, is the **Tier 2 self-assessment** option available for Apps Script projects? (Our app runs entirely on Google's infrastructure with no external servers)
4. Is there a different architecture you would recommend?

We have already implemented all your previous recommendations:
- Migrated to `drive.file` (from full `drive`)
- Migrated to `spreadsheets.currentonly`
- Removed DeepSeek integration completely
- Demo video: https://youtu.be/mUL0owqMxF4

The CASA assessment cost ($15k-75k) is prohibitive for a small developer. If there's no alternative, I understand, but I wanted to ask before making a decision.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
David

## Notes

- Send as reply to the original Google OAuth email thread
- If they confirm CASA is required, ask about Tier 2 self-assessment option for Apps Script projects
- CASA Tier 2 may only cost $500-$4,500 (not $15k-$75k which is Tier 3)

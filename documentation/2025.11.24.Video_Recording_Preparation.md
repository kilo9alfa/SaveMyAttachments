## 🎬 PRE-RECORDING CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Set Up Test Account

**Switch to test account:**
1. Open Chrome/browser in Incognito mode (recommended) or separate profile
2. Log in to: testingsavemyattachments@gmail.com
3. Verify you can access Gmail, Drive, and Sheets

### Step 2: Revoke Previous Permissions (CRITICAL!)

**To trigger the OAuth consent screen, you must revoke existing permissions:**

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
2. Find "SaveMyAttachments" in the list
3. Click on it → Click "Remove Access"
4. Confirm removal

**Why:** This ensures the OAuth consent screen will appear when you first open the app, which is Scene 1 of your video.

### Step 3: Prepare Test Data

**Gmail:**
- [ ] Have 2-3 test emails with attachments ready in the inbox
- [ ] Emails should be from different senders
- [ ] At least one email should have a PDF attachment

**Google Drive:**
- [ ] Create a test folder: "SaveMe Test Folder"
- [ ] Copy the folder URL (you'll need this in settings)

**Google Sheets:**
- [ ] Create a new spreadsheet: "SaveMe Test Sheet"
- [ ] Copy the sheet URL (you'll need this in settings)

### Step 4: Prepare OpenRouter API Key

**Option A: Use real API key (if you have one)**
- Log in to openrouter.ai with a test account
- Generate an API key
- Copy it for use in the video

**Option B: Use fake API key (for demo purposes)**
- Use a realistic-looking fake key: `sk-or-v1-1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklmnop`
- Note: This won't actually work, but you can show the UI flow
- You may need to skip the actual AI processing part if using fake key

### Step 5: Access SaveMyAttachments

**Apps Script Project URL:**
You'll need the Script ID to open the project.

**To find it:**
1. Go to: https://script.google.com
2. Open your SaveMyAttachments project
3. The URL will be: `https://script.google.com/home/projects/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/edit`

**Or use the standalone deployment URL if you've deployed it as a web app.**

## 🎥 RECORDING SETUP

### Browser Setup
- [ ] Close all unnecessary tabs

- [ ] Set resolution: 1920x1080 (minimum)
- [ ] Frame rate: 30fps (60fps if possible)
- [ ] Audio: Enable if adding voiceover live (or add in post)
- [ ] Test a 10-second clip to verify quality

### Screen Layout
- [ ] Open Gmail in one tab
- [ ] Open Drive in another tab
- [ ] Open Sheets in another tab
- [ ] Open SaveMyAttachments in main tab
- [ ] Practice switching between tabs smoothly

## 🎬 SCENE-BY-SCENE RECORDING GUIDE

### SCENE 1: OAuth Consent Screen (0:00-1:00)

**Action:**
1. Open SaveMyAttachments for the first time
2. **PAUSE** - Let the OAuth consent screen load completely
3. **HOLD ON SCREEN** for 5-7 seconds so viewers can see all 4 scopes
4. Slowly scroll down if needed to show all scopes
5. Click "Allow" button
6. Wait for app to load

**Voiceover:** "This demonstration shows SaveMyAttachments and its data segregation architecture for Google OAuth verification. First, the OAuth authorization flow..."

**Important:** If the OAuth screen doesn't appear, you didn't revoke permissions properly. Go back to Step 2.

---

### SCENE 2: Default State (1:00-1:30)

**Action:**
1. Once app loads, click "Settings" or open settings panel
2. Show that "Enable AI Summarization" checkbox is **unchecked**
3. Show empty API key field (greyed out)
4. Point cursor to these elements to highlight them

**Voiceover:** "After authorization is complete, this demonstration shows the default state. When a user first installs SaveMyAttachments, AI features are completely disabled..."

---

### SCENE 3: Enable AI Feature (1:30-2:30)

**Action:**
1. Check the "Enable AI Summarization" box
2. Show API key field becomes required (highlight changes)
3. Paste your API key (real or fake)
4. Click on "Model" dropdown
5. **PAUSE** - Show only Claude, GPT-4, Gemini options (no DeepSeek)
6. Select a model (e.g., "Claude 3.5 Sonnet")
7. Paste Google Drive folder URL
8. Paste Google Sheets URL
9. Click "Save Settings"

**Voiceover:** "Next, the process of enabling the AI feature. The user opens the settings panel and checks the Enable AI Summarization box..."

---

### SCENE 4: Email Processing (2:30-3:30)

**Action:**
1. Click "Process Emails Now" button
2. Show progress/status indicator
3. Wait for processing to complete (or show 10-15 seconds)
4. Switch to **Google Drive tab**
5. Navigate to your test folder
6. Show saved files (email PDFs and attachments)
7. Switch to **Google Sheets tab**
8. Show the new row(s) with email data and summary

**Voiceover:** "The settings are now saved. This demonstration shows how email processing works..."

**Note:** If using fake API key, the AI summary will fail, but you can still show Drive/Sheets logging working.

---

### SCENE 5: Data Segregation (3:30-4:30)

**Action:**
1. Go back to SaveMyAttachments
2. Click "Script Editor" or open Apps Script editor

     return '[Summary unavailable - DeepSeek models not supported]';
   }
   ```
3. Scroll down to lines 145-149
4. Show the API-level filtering code
5. Go back to **SettingsPanel.html**
6. Find lines 388-393 (model dropdown)
7. Show only Claude/GPT/Gemini in the code

**Voiceover:** "Finally, the DeepSeek blocking mechanism..."

**Option B: Try to Use DeepSeek (Advanced - Only if Comfortable)**

## 🎬 RECORDING TIPS

### Before You Hit Record:
1. Do a **dry run** - Practice the entire flow once
2. Close all notifications (Do Not Disturb mode)
3. Clean up desktop if you'll show it
4. Have the script visible on another screen or printed
5. Test your recording setup with a 30-second clip

### During Recording:
1. **Slow down** - Move mouse slowly, pause between actions
2. **Hold on important screens** - OAuth consent (5-7 sec), code (3-5 sec)
3. **Zoom in when needed** - Especially for code sections
4. **Don't rush** - Better to have a 7-minute video than miss important details
5. **Pause between scenes** - Makes editing easier

### After Recording:
1. Watch the entire video
2. Check that OAuth consent screen was captured clearly
3. Verify all 4 scopes are visible
4. Confirm DeepSeek blocking is shown
5. Make sure audio is clear (if recorded live)

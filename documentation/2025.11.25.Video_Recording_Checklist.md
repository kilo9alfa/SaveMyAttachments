# Demo Video Recording Checklist
**Purpose:** Show OAuth authorization flow + narrower scopes implementation
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes
**Date:** November 25, 2025

---

## PRE-RECORDING SETUP

### Required:
- [ ] New Google Sheet created (SaveMyAttachments will be bound to this)
- [ ] Apps Script project deployed to the new sheet
- [ ] Test Gmail account with a few emails containing attachments
- [ ] OpenRouter API key ready (real or fake: "sk-or-v1-abc123...")
- [ ] Screen recording software ready (1080p minimum)

### Optional but recommended:
- [ ] Revoke existing app permissions: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
- [ ] Clear browser cache for fresh OAuth experience
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs

---

## SCENE 1: Introduction & OAuth Flow (0:00-1:00)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Open the new Google Sheet
- [ ] Click SaveMyAttachments menu > any option
- [ ] OAuth consent screen appears
- [ ] **PAUSE HERE** - Show the scopes clearly:
  - `gmail.readonly` - "View your email messages and settings"
  - `drive.file` - "See, edit, create, and delete only specific Google Drive files"
  - `spreadsheets.currentonly` - "See, edit, create, and delete only this spreadsheet"
  - Additional script scopes (may be grouped)
- [ ] Click "Allow" button
- [ ] Show successful authorization

**Key message:** These are the MINIMUM scopes - drive.file (not full drive), spreadsheets.currentonly (not all spreadsheets)

---

## SCENE 2: Settings Panel - Default State (1:00-1:30)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Click SaveMyAttachments menu > Configure Settings
- [ ] Show Settings Panel opens
- [ ] Point out:
  - No folder configured yet
  - AI Summarization is **OFF by default**
  - API key field is empty
- [ ] This proves: No data processing until user explicitly sets it up

---

## SCENE 3: Set Up Drive Folder (1:30-2:00)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Click "Set Up Drive Folder" button
- [ ] Show success message: "Created folder: SaveMyAttachments"
- [ ] Show the folder link appears
- [ ] **Key point:** App CREATES its own folder using Advanced Drive Service (drive.file compatible)
- [ ] Optionally: Open Drive in new tab, show the folder exists

**Key message:** We use Advanced Drive Service as recommended by Google. App creates its own folder - doesn't browse user's existing folders. This is why drive.file scope is sufficient.

---

## SCENE 4: Enable AI (Optional Feature) (2:00-2:30)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Check "Enable AI Summarization" checkbox
- [ ] Show API key field becomes required
- [ ] Paste API key (user's own key)
- [ ] Show model dropdown - **ONLY Claude, GPT-4, Gemini visible**
- [ ] **Key point:** No DeepSeek models available
- [ ] Click Save Configuration

**Key message:** AI is opt-in, user provides their own key, DeepSeek blocked

---

## SCENE 5: Process Emails (2:30-3:30)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Click "Process New Emails Now"
- [ ] Show processing toast/progress
- [ ] Wait for completion message
- [ ] Show the spreadsheet - new row(s) added with email data
- [ ] Show columns: Date, Sender, Subject, AI Summary, Attachments, Drive Links
- [ ] Click a Drive link - show file saved in the SaveMyAttachments folder

**Key message:** Data flows: Gmail -> App-created Drive folder -> Bound spreadsheet

---

## SCENE 6: DeepSeek Blocking (Optional - 3:30-4:00)

**Option A: Show in code (simpler)**
- [ ] Open Apps Script editor (Extensions > Apps Script)
- [ ] Open OpenRouterService.gs
- [ ] Show lines 16-20: DeepSeek blocking code
- [ ] Read the comment: "Filter out DeepSeek models for Google OAuth compliance"

**Option B: Runtime demo (more dramatic)**
- [ ] In Script Editor, modify model variable to "deepseek-chat"
- [ ] Run test function
- [ ] Show error: "Summary unavailable - DeepSeek models not supported"

---

## SCENE 7: Summary (4:00-4:30)

**What to show:**
- [ ] Quick recap (can use split screen or quick cuts):
  - OAuth screen showing minimal scopes
  - Settings with AI disabled by default
  - Drive folder created by app using Advanced Drive Service (not browsing user folders)
  - Editor Add-on only accesses active spreadsheet (not all user's sheets)
  - DeepSeek blocked

**Key message:** Minimal scopes, user control, data segregation, DeepSeek blocked

---

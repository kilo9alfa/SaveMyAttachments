## ✅ STEP 1: Reset OAuth Permissions (CRITICAL for Video!)

**This must be done FIRST to show the OAuth consent screen in your video.**

### Instructions:

1. **Open Incognito/Private window** (or use a separate browser profile)

2. **Log in to test account:**
   - Email: testingsavemyattachments@gmail.com
   - (Use your password)

3. **Go to Google Account Permissions:**
   - Navigate to: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
   - Or: Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access

4. **Find and Remove SaveMyAttachments:**
   - Look for "SaveMyAttachments" in the list
   - If you don't see it, try searching for your script name
   - Click on it → Click "Remove Access" or "Revoke"
   - Confirm the removal

5. **Verify removal:**
   - The app should no longer appear in your permissions list
   - This ensures the OAuth screen will appear fresh

**Why this is critical:** The OAuth consent screen only appears the FIRST time a user grants permissions. By revoking access, you reset this state and can record the OAuth flow for your demo video.

## ✅ STEP 2: Create Test Environment (Spreadsheet + Folder)

### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)

**Run the helper function I just created:**

1. **Open Apps Script Editor:**
   - Go to: https://script.google.com
   - Find your SaveMyAttachments project
   - Make sure you're logged in as testingsavemyattachments@gmail.com

2. **Run createTestEnvironment function:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, find the function dropdown (top toolbar)
   - Select: `createTestEnvironment`
   - Click the "Run" button (▶️ play icon)

3. **Grant permissions (OAuth will appear):**
   - First run will trigger OAuth consent screen
   - **IMPORTANT:** This is your Scene 1! Start recording HERE!
   - Click "Allow" to grant all 4 scopes
   - Function will execute

4. **Get URLs:**
   - Check the Execution Log (View → Logs or Cmd/Ctrl+Enter)
   - You'll see:
     ```
     ✅ Created test spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/...
     ✅ Created test folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/...
     ```
   - Copy both URLs for use in video

5. **Alternative:** A popup will also show the URLs
   - Copy the URLs from the alert dialog

**What this creates:**
- ✅ Google Sheet named: "SaveMe Test Sheet - 2025.11.24"
- ✅ Drive folder named: "SaveMe Test Folder - 2025.11.24"
- ✅ Sheet has proper headers: Date, Sender, Subject, AI Summary, Attachments, Drive Links
- ✅ Both ready to use in demo video

---

### Option B: Manual Creation

**If you prefer to create manually:**

1. **Create Test Spreadsheet:**
   - Go to: https://sheets.google.com
   - Click "Blank" to create new sheet
   - Name it: "SaveMe Test Sheet - 2025.11.24"
   - Add header row: Date | Sender | Subject | AI Summary | Attachments | Drive Links
   - Bold the header row
   - Copy the URL

2. **Create Test Folder:**
   - Go to: https://drive.google.com
   - Click "New" → "Folder"
   - Name it: "SaveMe Test Folder - 2025.11.24"
   - Copy the URL

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Prepare Test Emails

**Send a few test emails to testingsavemyattachments@gmail.com:**

### Email 1: Simple Test
- **From:** Your personal email
- **Subject:** "Test Email for Demo - Invoice #1234"
- **Body:** "This is a test invoice email. Amount: $500. Due date: December 1, 2025."
- **Attachment:** Any PDF file (rename it to "invoice.pdf")

### Email 2: Another Test
- **From:** Another email address
- **Subject:** "Meeting Notes - Q4 Planning"
- **Body:** "Here are the meeting notes from today's planning session."
- **Attachment:** Any document or image

### Email 3: Plain Email (No Attachment)
- **From:** Your email
- **Subject:** "Follow-up on Project Status"
- **Body:** "Just checking in on the project status. Let me know if you need anything."
- **Attachment:** None

**Why 3 emails?**
- Shows the app works with different email types
- Demonstrates attachment handling and no-attachment scenarios
- Provides visible results in Drive and Sheets

## ✅ STEP 4: Prepare OpenRouter API Key

### Option A: Real API Key (if you have OpenRouter account)

1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to: https://openrouter.ai/keys
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)

### Option B: Fake API Key for Demo (simpler)

Use this realistic-looking fake key:
```
sk-or-v1-1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Note:** Fake key won't work for actual AI processing, but you can:
- Show the UI flow (settings, configuration)
- Show email saving to Drive (works without AI)
- Show logging to Sheets (works without AI)
- AI summary column will show error, which is OK for demo

**Recommended:** Use real key if you have one, or create free account at OpenRouter (they often give free credits).

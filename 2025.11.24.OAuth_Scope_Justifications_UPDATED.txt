# OAuth Scope Justifications for OAuth Consent Screen (UPDATED)
**Project:** SaveMyAttachments
**Date:** November 24, 2025 (Updated for drive scope)

---

## JUSTIFICATION 1: drive + spreadsheets + script.external_request
**Character Limit:** 1000 characters
**Character Count:** 999 characters

---

For .../auth/drive scope:
This scope enables creating dynamic folder structures to organize saved emails and attachments. Users configure folder templates like {year}/{month}/{sender} requiring programmatic folder creation. The drive.file scope is insufficient because it cannot create folders (only files). The app creates nested folder hierarchies within user-specified parent folders based on email metadata for organized archiving.

For .../auth/spreadsheets scope:
This scope logs email metadata to user-specified Google Sheets. Users provide existing spreadsheet URLs as configuration settings (not via Google Picker). The app appends one row per email. drive.file cannot access pre-existing user spreadsheets by URL.

For .../auth/script.external_request scope:
This scope enables optional AI summarization via OpenRouter.ai. Feature is disabled by default and requires users' own API keys. Email content sent directly from user's environment to user's OpenRouter account with zero developer access.

---

## JUSTIFICATION 2: gmail.readonly
**Character Limit:** 1000 characters
**Character Count:** 547 characters

---

For .../auth/gmail.readonly scope:
This scope enables reading email messages and metadata (sender, subject, date, body text) to back up emails and attachments to Google Drive. The app processes emails based on user-defined Gmail search filters (e.g., "from:client@company.com has:attachment"). Email content is read to: (1) Convert emails to PDF/HTML/text format for archival; (2) Extract and save attachments to Drive; (3) Generate optional AI summaries (if user enables and provides their own API key); (4) Log email metadata to Google Sheets. The app only reads emails matching user filters and never modifies or deletes emails.

SaveMyAttachments - OAuth Verification Demo

Hello. This is a demonstration of SaveMyAttachments, showing how the app uses the OAuth scopes requested.

Step 1: OAuth Authorization

When a user first runs SaveMyAttachments, they see the OAuth consent screen requesting permissions: gmail.readonly to read email messages, drive to save backups to Google Drive, spreadsheets to write the searchable index, and script.external_request to call the AI API.

The user clicks Advanced, then Go to SaveMyAttachments, and grants the permissions by clicking Allow.

Step 2: Reading Gmail

SaveMyAttachments uses gmail.readonly to search for emails matching the user's filter. In this example, we're searching for emails with attachments. The app reads the email content, sender information, and retrieves any attachments.

Step 3: Saving to Google Drive

Using the drive scope, SaveMyAttachments saves the email as a PDF and uploads all attachments to the user's specified Google Drive folder. You can see the organized folder structure and the saved files here.

Step 4: Writing to Google Sheets

Using the spreadsheets scope, the app creates a new row in the user's index spreadsheet. This row contains the email date, sender, subject, an AI-generated summary, and clickable links to the files in Google Drive.

Privacy and Security

All email processing happens entirely within the user's Google account. Email content is sent to the AI provider only via the user's own API key. We do not store, transmit, or access any email content on our servers. Users maintain full control over their data at all times.
